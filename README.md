# PIC18F4550-Heat-Responsive-Fan
An embedded system on PIC18F4550 integrates temperature sensing, PWM control, encoder‐based speed measurement, LCD display, and UART output. The LM35 sensor’s temperature is shown on a 2×16 LCD, motor speed (pulses/s) is counted via INT0, and data is sent at 9600 bps over UART.
